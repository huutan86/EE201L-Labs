		For Practice state, the SSD should output the switches
		otherwise it should output the outputNumber (the generated number)
		
		I put this in the top file, and I don't know if I did it correctly or not
		
		If you find an error, it's probably there.
		
		So SSD should look at SSD_Output
		
		Look at lines 155 to 164 of game_top.v
